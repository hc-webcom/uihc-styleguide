				<p>Then, just 12 days after a 7.5-hour transplant surgery, Mason went home to stay.</p>
				<blockquote class="pull-quote-left"><p>Following his roller-coaster first six months of life, Mason today is an active four-year-old: a big brother to two-year-old sister Lily, a T-ball player, a pizza fanatic, and a loyal Hawkeye fan. The anti-rejection medicines and precautions to prevent infection are part of the family's routine.</p></blockquote>
				<p>Trips back to UI Children's Hospital for regular check ups give Mason a chance to see Kinnick Stadium close up.</p>
				<p>On a recent visit, he offered: "We're gonna go to the field today so I can get bigger and bigger to play in the Hawkeye football stadium."</p>
				<p>And who else does he plan to see there?</p>
				<p>"Herky is my favorite in the Iowa Hawkeye stadium."</p>
				<p>Doctors say that by the time Mason is old enough to see Hawkeye mascot Herky from the student section in Kinnick, he will have to undergo another heart transplant, due to normal developmental changes.</p>

				<p>Tonia has struggled with chronic kidney disease for 15 years. The disease has led to several side effects, but most personal for Tonia has been the stigma of poor body image. That’s tough for a college theatre instructor who teaches aspiring actors the art of portraying romantic scenes on stage.</p>
				<blockquote class="pull-quote-right"><p>“I needed to see myself as a woman, as a beautiful person, which is hard to do when you have tubes coming out of you,” she says.</p></blockquote>
				<p>So, she started a blog. Originally used as a channel to share her experience with followers, her blog developed into a personal outlet. Tonia posts professional pictures of herself on “Kidneys and Pinups” in an effort to document her body’s transformations and her struggle to accept those changes throughout her journey.</p>
