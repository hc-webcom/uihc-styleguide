<h1>Get the Facts: Sun, Sunscreen, and Skin</h1>
<h2>Protect Your Skin From Sun Damage</h2>
<h3>SPF and UV Rays</h3>
<p>When comparing products that protect the skin from the harmful effects of UVB rays, the term "sun protection factor (SPF)" is often used. For example, if you used a sunscreen having a sun protection factor of 5, then theoretically you could stay outside in the sunlight five times longer before getting a sunburn compared to the time required to get a sunburn without using the sunscreen. The SPF relates only to the ability of a sunscreen to block sunburning UVB rays. The SPF number does not relate to the ability of a sunscreen to block UVA rays.</p>
<h3>Avoid Direct Sun Exposure</h3>
<p>You should avoid direct sun exposure and artificial tanning devices as much as possible. One should be especially careful to avoid midday sun exposure. Midday summer sunlight has the greatest concentration and intensity of UVB and UVA rays.  </p>
<p class="pull-quote-right">A useful rule of thumb is that if your shadow is longer than you are tall there is less danger from the damaging effects of UV rays. This generally applies before 10 AM and later-than 4 PM in the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to check the UV Index each day and dress accordingly. The UV Index is a prediction of the sun’s UV ray strength on any given day at noon in a particular geographic region. The local daily UV Index is usually available via the local newspaper, television or radio. Look at our Ultraviolet Index for more information.</p>

<p>Harmful UV rays can also reflect off water and light colored surfaces (e.g., concrete, sand, and snow). This can double the amount of UVB rays that strike your skin. UV rays also reach below the surface of water — three feet of water blocks only 20% of UV rays. Sunscreen should be used even on cloudy days when up to 80% of UV rays can still reach the earth’s surface. In addition, repeated small exposures to UV rays may account for 80% of total exposure over a lifetime. Daily use of a sunscreen is very important since intermittent application is much less protective. You should wear lightweight, tightly-woven clothing and broad brimmed hats.</p>
